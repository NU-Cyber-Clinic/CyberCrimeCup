# We first ran zsteg over stegcode.png it found
# a string at b1,r,lsb,xy with the start of
# the flag was in there so I used the below
# to extract the full string and get the flag
zsteg -E b1,r,lsb,xy stegcode.png
{ccc_steg:652393267x4}

# Next we looked at steg-monster-art.png and
# read the binary from around to get
# http://stegmonster.co.uk/ and got the second flag
{ccc_steg:007456106x2}

# Next we cropped the center of
# steg-monster-art.png and ran zsteg
# on it and got the start of some
# ascii art, extracted that for the flag
zsteg -E b1,r,lsb,xy steg-monster-art2.png
{ccc_steg:493247463x3}

# Then looking at scramble.png
# after the following cleanup by Joe
## smaller (dark blue) binary fuzziness 200, bigger (green) binary fuzziness 0
# I then skewed the image to make the 
# flag clear and appended x1 to it to
# follow the other formats
