# First we opened the source of the page
# in there we found a HTML comment with
# the sixth flag
{ccc_cry:836455593x6}

# The first flag was a simple ROT cypher
# we used dcode.fr to brute force it
# we got ASCII[!-~]+93 as the best result 
# and from that output we got the flag
{ccc_cry:947264835x1}


# The second flag was found using the same
# method as the first but this time we got
# ASCII+1 as the ROT sequence
{ccc_cry:739351804x2}

# The forth flag was found again by using 
# dcode.fr and got ASCII+122 as the ROT
# sequence getting us this flag
{ccc_cry:453950722x4}

# For the third flag we started with
# the ROT brute force and got ASCII+1
# as the best squence but it was still
# a mess, so from there we extraced a
# string that followed the flag format
{dcd_drz:794755309x4}
# we then started looking at it and Joe
# worked out that every other character
# needed to be replaced with the one before
# it in the alphabet

every 4th letter, move back 4 spaces, then: select 3 first letters, move to front, select next 1 letter, append to front, select next 3, move to front, select next 1, append to front, etc.
